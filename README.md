## Introduction

ED-E is a templating language written in Haskell with a specific set of features:

* **Logicless (within reason):** A small set of consistent predicates and expressions for formatting and presentational logic are provided.
* **Secure:** No arbitrary code evaluation, with input data required to be fully specified at render time.
* **Stateless:** Parsing and rendering are separate steps so that loading, parsing, include resolution, and embedding of the compiled template can optionally be done ahead of time, amortising cost.
* **Markup agnostic:** ED-E is used to write out everything from configuration files for system services, to HTML and formatted emails.
* **Control over purity:** Users can choose pure or IO-based resolution of `include` expressions.
* **No surprises:** All parsing, type assurances, and rendering steps report helpful error messages with line/column metadata. Variable shadowing, unprintable expressions, implicit type coercion, and unbound variable access are all treated as errors errors.

Please see the [documentation](http://brendanhay.github.io/ede/Text-EDE.html)
for more information.


## Syntax

A set of syntatic/semantic fragments for all supported expressions can be
found in the [tests](test/resources) or the [documentation](http://brendanhay.github.io/ede/Text-EDE.html#syntax).
